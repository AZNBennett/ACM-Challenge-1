# GRU-based Deepfake Detection with MiniGPT-4

This project adapts the open-source [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4) model for the task of video-based deepfake detection by implementing GRU with our frame analysis.

The model processes multiple frames for each video, encodes the info with MiniGPT's architecture, and uses LoRA fine-tuning for binary classification (real vs fake). The model will also target
